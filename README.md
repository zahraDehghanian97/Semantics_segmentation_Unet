# Semantics_segmentation_Unet
we will develop a U-Net for semantics segmentation of lung CT-scans.  For this project, we will use a dataset consisting of CT-scans from lungs of COVID-19 patients. The regions affected by COVID-19 are marked with labels of ground glass opacity. we will be training and testing the U-Net model on this dataset.
